# clearterm

ClearTerm will create a standard method to visually represent the structure of elected bodies.  The final scope of this project has not been determined, but some basic elements of the final product will include:
-# of seats on the board
-Method of selection (elected/appointed)
-Process for election when applicable (i.e. At Large, single/multiple member districts, etc...)
-Term Lengths
-Threshold for selection/election (majority, plurality, etc...)

Once a standard has been created a simple program will be written for use on any government website.

Inspiration for this project is drawn from Nikki Sylianteng's (http://nikkisylianteng.com/project/parking-sign-redesign/) work on parking signs and years of sifting through opaque government websites.

Please let me know if you would like to collaborate on this project.
